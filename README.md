# Bootlegger
The Capstone project for the front end portion of Nashville Software School calling from a ruby api. It is a craft beer locator app. The front-end section is currently not fully implemented. The front-end is unstyled and lacking a map, but it is displaying data from the api (a huge win for me personally) and the functioning front-end is written in with ember.
